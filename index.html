  <p>It seems like potatoes manifest themselves in almost every culture in some way, shape, or form. Of course, the largest contributor to this undeniable popularity is the simplicity in which potatoes can be cultivated and readily available, but in a day and age where grocery shelves are filled to the brim with a plethora of satiating choices, why is it that potatoes are still amongst the most popular items to buy?
  An extended explanation would point out that they can be grown in almost any climate, whether it be arid or tropical; they provide more nutritious sustenance faster and on less land than any other crop in the world, and they can be utilized to make just about any type of dish: cold, hot, fried, baked, sliced, dished, even alcoholic!</p>
